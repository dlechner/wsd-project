		<h3>31 Jan 2012: Tuesday Server Maintenance and Patch Notes.</h3>
		<p>Realms are back up after maintenance and Patch Notes can be found on the official forums, <ahref="http://www.swtor.com/patchnotes/1.1.1/1312012"><strong>LINK HERE</strong></a>	The bulk of this patch address numerous bugs throughout the different classes, flashpoints and operations.  Of note is the fix to the Global Cooldown where it looked like the cooldown was finished but it actually was still in effect.  As far as classes, the long wait for the fix on Scoundrel/Agent burst damage has been implemented, effectively reducing their sneak attacks damage by 20%.  This one is long overdue as they have both been able to singlehandedly turn the tide of a warzone with their 1-2shot player kills.  Another welcome bug fix is on the Voidstar WZ, attacking players can no longer climb over the barrier wall in the hangar spawn area.  I never seen Republic players do this, but the Sith would exploit this all the time and they could have bombs planted on the first set of doors before the Republics could even leave their spawn area.  For more detail patch notes follow the link above.</p>
